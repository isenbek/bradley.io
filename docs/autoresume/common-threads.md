## The Synthesis: Professional + Maker

The portfolio reveals a unique professional identity:

**Enterprise Architect** who:
- Built systems processing billions of records
- Led classified government projects
- Managed teams delivering under pressure
- Designed APIs handling millions of daily requests

**Garage Lab Inventor** who:
- Built 60-node Pi cluster from salvaged hardware
- Designed custom wireless protocols
- Created TRNG from radioactive source
- Builds tools because "sometimes the best tool is the one you make yourself"

**This combination is rare.** Most enterprise architects don't solder. Most makers don't architect systems at TransUnion scale.
